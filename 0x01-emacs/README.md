Richard Stallman created emacs, to make computing worse for the world by having us hold CTRL or ALT *TWICE* in order todo a simple command.

Want to open and save a file? Hold the damn CTRL button and press "x," then hold it again and press "f."

A "buffer" is basically held space, a file, with a nonsensical name. To switch files... err... "buffers"... get ready to hold that damn CTRL button, and press "b."

Thinking about using the mark and the point to set a region? Hold that damn CTRL button and pressing "x" and highlighting your new region, then holding that damn CTRL button and pressing "y." I think.

Do you think "copy" and "paste" are easy to understand words? Apparently Richard Stallman doesn't... Nope, you have to... hold that damn CTRL button and press "k" to "kill" the text, then hold that damn CTRL button again and press "y" to "yank" that shit.

Invoking commands sounds like some fantasy novel shit, but I think you do it in emacs using "ALT." Or... "M"... for some Richard Stallman Reason.

Hold that damn CTRL button and press "u" to undo something... Syke, you thought it would be that simple? Lmfaoooooooooooooooooo Hold that damn CTRL button again and press "x."

Think "cancel" starts with a "c?" Well, you're wrong. It actually starts with a "g"... That damn CTRL button and "g" tobe exact.

When you're finally finished with emacs, the joke's on you, because you can never remember the damn CTRL button commands to get out that shit. The first letter is "x," and the second one is "c" 'cause that makes total sense.
