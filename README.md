A virtual machine is an emulation of an operating system environment, and Vagrant is a tool
created by software developer Mitchell Hashimoto that helps interacting in those environments.

Ubuntu, originally a word meaning "human" in Zulu culture, is a UNIX distribution.

Vagrant makes interacting with virtual environments easier by managing configurations automatically
without the need for the user to do so.

Zero-day refers to exploits that become active without prior knowledge by security researchers or
the developers of the software.
