vi is the better version of emacs, from Bill Joy.

Creating files in vi is easier than emacs: vi filename
Exiting vi makes more sense than vi: :q

insert mode --> typing time
command mode --> morphing time

Ok, I don't get why all these commands are necessary when 'Backspace' exists, but at least it's better
than that damn CTRL button *TWICE*.

To copy and paste, you yy-Wild Thoughts that text and p-ut that shit wherever you want afterwards.

Front slash like Michael Myers, then find that word!
Question mark for searching backwards, because who knows why we can't use back slash.

Who would have thought "u" would undo?
